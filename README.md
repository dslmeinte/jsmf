# JSMF

JSMF is intended to be an extremely light-weight (and thoroughly feature-incomplete, simplified) version of EMF in the JavaScript space.

It's primary purpose is to serve as the abstract syntax framework for models transported to a partly re-written Concrete Model Editor - instead of the current DOM-based approach.
As such, it resembles an amalgamation of EMF and the representations used by the Concrete Model Editor - in particular that for the meta model.

It's going to be using JQuery (instead of Prototype.js), for future-proofness.
